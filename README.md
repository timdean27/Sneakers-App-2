# Sneakers-Collection-App

## About The Project

As a personal collecter/reseller of sneakers I wanted to create an app that will let me categorize, add, update, and delete sneakers in my collection/inventory as well as a page to keep track of upcoming releases.

I also wanted to keep some minor accounting information to track when the sneaker was sold, for how much, and if the sale was profitable.
